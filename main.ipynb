You can read the rest of our series here. This time last year we did something reckless. In an industry where nothing stands still, we had a go at predicting the future. How did we do? Our four big bets for 2023 were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s executive order came out in October and the European Union’s AI Act was finally agreed in December); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups\n",

The potential impact of humanoids on various sectors makes them an exciting area of development, but their mass market adoption remains a complex challenge.

      "Content: AI image generators capable of? An AI image generator is software that uses a generative AI model to create images from user text inputs, usually within seconds. The pictures vary in style depending on the software's capabilities, but they can typically be rendered in any style you want: 3D, 2D, cinematic, modern, Renaissance, and more.If you've ever searched Google for hours to find an image you needed, artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to help.With AI image generators, you can type in a prompt that is as detailed or vague as you'd like. These tools can help with branding, social media content creation, and making invitations, flyers, business cards, and more.Also: ChatGPT no longer requires a login, but you might want one anyway. Here's whyAnother major perk of these generators is that they take seconds to generate, with the longest generation taking about a minute. Even if you have no professional use for AI, don't worry -- the process is so fun that anyone can (and should)\n",

In the most optimistic scenario, bans on certain AI uses could apply as soon as the end of the year.\\nThis all means 2024 will be a busy year for the AI sector as it prepares to comply with the new rules. Although most AI applications will get a free pass from the AI Act, companies developing foundation models and applications that are considered to pose a “high risk” to fundamental rights, such as those meant to be used in sectors like education, health care, and policing, will have to meet new EU standards. In Europe, the police will not be allowed to use the technology in public places, unless they get court approval first for specific purposes such as fighting terrorism, preventing human trafficking, or finding a missing person.\\n\\nSource: https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/04/existing-and-proposed-federal-ai-regulation-in-the-united-states\\nTitle: \\r\\n        Existing and Proposed Federal AI Regulation in the United States – Publications\\r\\n    \\nContent: started in November 2023.
